        <p>Paul Graham’s short and sober essay <a
                                                       href="https://paulgraham.com/writes.html">Writes and Write-Nots</a>
        strongly resonated with me: Maybe writing is the next big thing, not
        <em>despite</em> the fact that it can easily be replicated using AI
        tools nowadays, but <em>because</em> of it: When everybody is delegating
        writing to AI tools, nobody will be capable of doing it on its own. And
        because clear thinking requires clear writing, as Paul Graham claims,
        only those who can write will be able to think in the future.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>[W]riting is thinking. In fact there’s a kind of thinking that can
            only be done by writing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This claim seems shaky, especially when one considers Sokrates, who
        didn’t hold writing in high esteem. But let’s accept this premise for
        the moment.</p>
        <p>If writing and thinking will become rare skills, those who are able
        to write and think will have huge benefits in the future. Those benefits
        will become clear within a generation, say, in 15-25 years, when those
        using AI tools for every task will establish themselves in the
        workforce.</p>
        <p>So the next big thing isn’t AI (or Blockchain, or Big Data, or
        DevOps, or Cloud Computing), it’s <em>thinking</em>. Investing time in
        reading (to get new material for thinking), thinking, and writing is the
        ultimate long-term bet.</p>
