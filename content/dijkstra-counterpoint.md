> There are very different programming styles. I tend to see them as Mozart
> versus Beethoven. When Mozart started to write, the composition was finished.
> He wrote the maniscript in one go. In beautiful handwriting, too. Beethoven
> was a doubter and a struggler, who started writing before he finished the
> composition and then glued corrections onto the page. In one place he did this
> nine times. When they peeled them, the last version proved identical to the
> first one. That iterative method of programming is somehow a very Anglo-Saxon
> custom. British education is pervaded by it. People learn, when they write,
> not to try to get it right the first time. Just write what's on your mind and
> then rewrite repeatedly to get the product you want. That's partly why word
> processors are marketed so aggressively and partly why they have been so
> successful there. While it is one of the advantages of working with pen and
> paper that when  you start a sentence, you should have it ready.
