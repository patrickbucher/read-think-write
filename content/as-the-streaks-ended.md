title: "As the Streaks Ended"

Today, two streaks are ending. First, I ended my [Daily Frontend
Grind](https://github.com/patrickbucher/daily-frontend-grind-q4-2024) yesterday
by throwing out the mediocre book _Essential TypeScript 5_. The book doesn't
give me anything the official documentation can. So I stopped working on
frontend technologies after a consistend effort that started at the end of
September. Maybe I'd like to implement something useful today, so that the
streak can go on, albeit in a different direction.

Second, I suffered a lumbago while rowing today. I first wanted to pull through,
but I gave up after a bit more than 30 minutes and 7 kilometers into my daily
exercise. I probably won't be able to row for two or three more days. A cold
back in September made me miss out a couple of days this year already. But since
then, I was consistent, and even got up earlier since. (I used to get up at 5:00
o'clock to row for 10 kilometers, now I get up at 4:30 to row for an entire
hour, which is roughly 13-14 kilometers, depending on my daily shape.)

Ending a streak always comes with some relief. The pressure is gone, and one can
start from scratch in a different way. There's also a phase of relaxation that
helps to build up new excitement. Having worked through a mediocre TypeScript
book annoyed me beyond the field of web development; I actually no longer
enjoyed programming. With some distance, the motivation usually comes back after
a couple of days.
