Almost a year ago, after having read Jocko Willink's little book _Discipline Equals Freedom_, I decided to get up early (5 o'clock a.m.) and exercise on my rowing ergometer every day. Today I checked the exercise logs and compiled this rough monthly breakdown:

- **August 2024**: 22/31 days (one hour per day). I was already rowing almost every day in August and must have started my habit in the second half that month. I rowed for an hour per exercise and managed to complete roughly between 13.3 and 14.0 kilometers. (My record is around 14.4km.) I always row on the hardest setting (10/10).
- **September 2024**: 24/30 days (one hour). I had a minor but long-lasting cold in the first third of the month, and I don't do cardio exercises until fully recovered. So I almost missed a full week.
- **October 2024**: 31/31 days (ten kilometers). I switched to 10 kilometers per exercise, which takes me 45 minutes on a regular day, and slightly less on a good day. I didn't miss a single day in October, and thanks to switching from daylight saving time to regular time, I got up even earlier (at 4:30 a.m.).
- **November 2024**: 30/30 days (ten kilometers). Another successful month without interrupting my streak.
- **December 2024**: 28/31 days (mix of ten kilometers and one hour). I remember suffering a lumbago while exercising on the 26th of December. This was disappointing because I didn't miss a single day since mid-September and managed to even row on Christmas. However, after a break of two days (I don't count the aborted exercise on December 26th), I was back on track. I did some hour-long exercises again.
- **January 2025**: 28/31 days (ten kilometers). I remember missing exercising on the 3rd of January after a hangover. There must have been other issues at least twice that caused me to abort or entirely miss exercises.
- **February 2025**: 18/28 days (ten kilometers). Unfortunately, I got sick again at the end of February, which caused me to miss some daily exercises. I also went on a short holiday, which was my first planned interruption since August.
- **March 2025**: 21/31 days (mix of ten kilometers and one hour). Having recovered from my heavy cold, I did some one hour exercises again, but stuck to 10 kilometers for the rest of the month.
- **April 2025**: 25/30 days (ten kilometers). This month was fairly consistent again. However, I missed some days again for various unremarkable reasons (digestive issues, headaches, failed to get up).
- **May 2025**: 30/31 days (ten kilometers). I had quite some hangover at the beginning of May that caused me to miss one single exercise, but I was consistent for the rest of the month.
- **June 2025**: 21/30 days (ten kilometers and one hour). Two things happened: My discipline collapsed and my knees started to hurt. I had minor issues with my legs before, which always got better _while_ exercising. But my knee issues weren't getting better, so I had to sit out a couple of days. Fortunately, everything was fine again in the last third of June, when I put in some one hour exercises again.
- **July 2025**: 11/31 days (ten kilometers). I still had issues with my discipline in July, but we also went on a holiday. Discipline was no issue after returning from the trip.
- **August 2025**: 6/6 days so far (ten kilometers). I got back into my habit, but after almost an entire year, I feel that I got stuck in my efforts. In order to really make progress (i.e. to row the 10 kilometers faster), exercising in the early morning is not the best idea, because I'm mostly fighting my tiredness. So I'll think about my future plans.

In sum, I managed to do 295 days out of 365, i.e. I missed roughly 70 days; some planned (holidays), some unplanned, mostly due to sickness and injury, but some also due to a lack of discipline. I had roughly 65 exercises of one hour and 230 exercises of ten kilometers. Calculating conservatively with 13.5 kilometers per hour, I managed to row 2400 kilometers, which is not bad for a year.

I was already thinking of switching my routine to rowing every other day, or on just two or three fixed days per week. Ten kilometers on Wednesday and one hour on either Saturday or Sunday sounds like a good idea. Having built up my stamina, I can now just preserve it.

This spring, I also started doing some push-ups after rowing. I usually do two sets of 25-33 repetitions, of which the second set is usually rather painful. But maybe I should keep up this habit. (Not rowing for 10 kilometers before doing push-ups might be easier, I hope).

Rowing every day is too hard for me in the long run. First, it has to be done in the early morning, because it's unfeasible later in the day during the summer because of the heat. And trying to do it later in the day just won't work consistently. Second, I noticed that I burned out this spring and had to pause. Despite having established a habit, daily rowing and getting up at 5 o'clock still required some willpower. I also had to take longer and more frequent naps during the day for the last couple of weeks and months. And since I'm not a professional athlete, I better change my priorities and lower my ambitions.

Talking about discipline: I started reading and summarizing Fyodor Dostoyevsky's _Brothers Karamazov_ on the first of May. I read and summarized a chapter almost every day. Having reached page 1000 of roughly 1250 pages, I also look forward to finish that project, after which I have resources for other endeavours.
