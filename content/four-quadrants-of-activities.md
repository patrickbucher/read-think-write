Our activities can be classified in four quadrants. The x-axis shows, how we
feel _during_ an activity, and the y-axis shows, how we feel _after_ the
activity. Both axes range from feeling bad—left/bottom—to feeling
good—right/top. (A z-axis showing how we feel _before_ the activity is not
considered for the sake of simplicity.)

The four quadrants are enumerated from top-right counter-clockwise, which gives
us the following categories:

- _Quadrant I_: Activities we enjoy doing and make us feel good afterwards.
- _Quadrant II_: Activities we don't enjoy doing, but making us feel better
  afterwards.
- _Quadrant III_: Activities we neither enjoy doing nor making us feel good
  afterwards.
- _Quadrant IV_: Activities we enjoy doing, but making us feel bad afterwards.

Activities of quadrant I are pure pleasure. Those are playful activities we
voluntarely do, like actual playing or having sex. However, the joy produced by
those activities diminishes quickly, and we need to find other activities to do.
It's almost impossible to fill one's day only with purely enjoyable activities,
which explains why even idle billionairs can get bored.

Quadrant II encompasses effortful but rewarding activities. Exercising on a
level that yields health benefits is not enjoyable, but makes us feel better
afterwards. We need to put up with a certain amount of pain in order to reap the
benefits of such activities. Focused learning or productive work belong to this
quadrant, too. Ideally, we enter the state of _flow_, turning work into play
(quadrant I). But the state of flow can only be entered after some initial
strain and therefore is rather to be seen as the reward for a phase of hard
work.

Nobody likes to do the activities of quadrant III. Unfortunately, a big part of
our education and working life takes place in this quadrant. No matter how well
we organize our lifes, we have to spend some time doing activities of this kind.
However, if we can reap some reward from the most tedious work, a quadrant III
activity can be turned into a quadrant II activity.

_First insight_: If we start with an activity that feels awkward, we still might
turn it around to become a rewarding endeavor. If we're happy with the result,
we also judge the strenous process in a more positive light. Mindset and
organisation are to a large extent techniques to turn quadrant III into quadrant
II activities.

Quadrant IV contains activities that feel good while doing them, but make us
feel bad afterwards. Drugs are the most obvious example. Spending time on social
media, which arguably _is_ a drug, feels the same. However, it's the dose makes
the poison: A dinner party with friends benefits from a couple of drinks, but
once you surpass a certain threshold (let's say: more than five to seven
drinks), the evening might become a bit more enjoyable, but the next day less
so. Quadrant IV activities always come with remorse.

For a lot of people, watching TV is a quadrant IV activity. After a long time of
abstinence (now 17 years in my case), the activity itself doesn't feel good
anymore, but rather nauseating. The same is true for social media or following
the news, after one has stopped using them for a couple of years. Video games
probably were the worst offenders in my youth. They completely overexcite us,
which not only makes it impossible to do any meaningful things for the rest of
the day, but also cause bad sleep, ruining the next day.

## People

What about people? Can we classify them using the same quadrants? How do we feel
while and after interacting with different kinds of people?

In quadrant I, we have the people we could spend our entire time together. A
good spouse, one's own kids or a very best friend belong here.

Quadrant II is harder. Are there any people we don't like dealing with, but we
feel better after having dealt with them—by which not the relief is meant that
the interaction is finished! Only artificial examples like a drill seargant come
to my mind: We hate that guy during a workout, but are grateful that he
compensated our lack of discipline for some time. Very tough teachers are
a possible example. It's not always fun to be around them, but in hindsight,
you're glad you had them. However, in my experience, those teachers never make
you feel genuinly bad in their classes, otherwise you wouldn't be able to
actually learn.

_Second insight_: We must seek _activities_ of the second quadrant, but not
people. Activities of quadrant II are often accompanied by people, but here the
activity is the most important thing, not the people. Jogging with a good friend
is still a quadrant II activity, but the friend is not a quadrant II person. He
doesn't make you feel bad during the exercise, quite the opposite.

People of the third quadrant make us feel bad while and after dealing with them.
We try to avoid such people as much as possible. However, at work or in school,
we cannot escape from them. We have to deal with such people and limit their
influence they have on us.

Are there any quadrant IV people? Those are people that make us feel good while
we deal with them, but leave a bad feeling once our interaction with them is
over. Again, here it's important to distinguish the person from the activity we
perform with that person. A husband going to a prostitute certainly feels good
during the interaction, but has remorse afterwards. However, this has nothing to
do with the prostitute, it's his cheating that makes him feel bad.

If drugs are a quadrant IV activity, are there also people that have an
intoxicating effect on us? I'm not talking about drug dealers here—people that
will make a junkie feeling excited during the interaction, but being hated by
their customers afterwards for selling them harmful stuff. Are there any people
we interact with in a legal and moral way (just talking, spending the time
together) that make us feel good while we spend time together, but leave us with
a feeling of emptiness or despair once we parted ways?

I'm not talking about people falling in love with one another; because they are
"high" during and after their interactions. They just yearn for one another
without any harm involved.

People that make us feel good during the interaction but bad afterwards are
_demons_. They are very attractive and alluring. However, they drain our energy.
Oftentimes, they lead us away from other people of the good kind, thereby
harming our positive relationships, and monopolize our attention. Cult leaders
are a good example for this.

At the beginning, their appeal is stronger then the remorse we feel after the
interaction. It's possible to meet again, to feel "high" once more, and no harm
is done, at least not initially. However, the more dependent we become of such
demons
