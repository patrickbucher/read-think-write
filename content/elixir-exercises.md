I'd like to pick up Elixir again by working through _Elixir in Action_ (3rd
Edition). However, since I already worked through most of the 2nd edition of the
same book, my usual approach of reading and summarizing will probably not be
motivating enough. So I thought of a different approach.

For every concept I encounter, I create a little programming problem, which can
be solved by applying the respective problem. I'll write a small article
consisting of a theory block explaining the concept, a problem block describing
an issue to be solved with the concept at hand, and a sample solution resolving
the problem in a idiomatic manner. A little surplus section with additional
background information could be useful, too.

With this approach, I not only think more about the concepts to be learned, but
I also learn how to create programming exercises. This is a skill I absolutely
need to cultivate: takig a concept, and preparing a problem for it.

I might also consider creating problems spanning multiple new concepts. Such
exercises should hint to the concepts being used to solve the problem. This
could be end-of-chapter exercises that synthesize the things just learned. The
result would be a small exercises book, some kind of companion to the actual
book.

I need to further elaborate on the idea, but it certainly adds some intellectual
burden to the task of getting back into Elixir. The same approach would also be
interesting to learn Phoenix, adding depth to the process of working through a
tutorial book.
