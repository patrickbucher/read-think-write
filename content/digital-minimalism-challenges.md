I comitted myself to an [information diet](#10) during the month of December. I
was doing very good for the first week, and sticking to my plan felt easy,
almost _too_ easy. However, I got sidetracked during the weekend.

First, I heard of a major upheaval in Syria through the official communication
channel of a company I'm working for (Slack). Even though this channel is
supposed to be used for work-related discussions, some major events will make
it through it, which is understandable.

I couldn't resist the urge to check what was happening. I wasn't spending any
time reading about the back story, because that usually makes little sense until
the fog of war is clearing. However, it seems to me that Russia and Iran pulled
the plug on Syria, maybe allowing Turkey some land grab. There will be more
substantial information to be read in a couple of weeks, so let's see.

Second, I was a huge fan of Iron Maiden for now more than 20 years. Their
drummer, Nicko McBrain, decided to step back from touring with the band as of
last Saturday. I played the drums when I was young and picked it up again a year
ago, and Nicko McBrain really was my hero for all those years.

I read the announcement on the official website of the band, which I visit once
in a while. However, I couldn't resist the urge to go to the official forum. I
spent very little time there at the beginning, because I didn't care a lot about
the speculations who's going to be Nicko's replacement. But since the
announcement came out _before_ the last concert, I really hoped for a good final
show, on which I wanted to check the next day.

The verdicts of the fans were unanimous: Nicko and the entire band finished the
tour with an absolute outstanding performance. I watched a couple of videos that
showed Nicko's last minutes on the stage, after which he took farewell of the
audience forever.

Fortunately, the new drummer was already announced a day later on the official
website, ending all the pointless speculations in the forums. I checkout out the
forum again, and the discussions were just the usual complaints. A couple of
members pointed out that Nicko's replacement Simon Dawson was probably already
preparing to step in during the last tour, on which British Lion (the band for
which Simon Dawson plays) accompanied Iron Maiden. But that was the most
reasonable thing I read within the hour I spent on that forum. What a waste of
time.

Third, I also checked out some news on Alpine Skiing. TODO

However, there are some lessons to be learned:
