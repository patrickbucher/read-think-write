I comitted myself to an [information diet](#10) during the month of December. I
was doing very good for the first week, and sticking to my plan felt easy,
almost _too_ easy. However, I got sidetracked during the weekend.

First, I heard about a major upheaval in Syria through the Slack channel of a
company I'm working for. Even though this channel is supposed to be used for
work-related discussions, some major news will make it through it, which is
understandable.

I couldn't resist the urge to check what was happening. I wasn't spending any
time reading about the back story, because that usually makes little sense until
the fog of war is clearing. There will be more substantial information to be
read in a couple of weeks, so let's read about that in January… or maybe not.

Second, I was a huge fan of Iron Maiden for now more than 20 years. Their
drummer, Nicko McBrain, decided to step back from touring with the band as of
last Saturday. I played the drums when I was young and picked it up again a year
ago, and Nicko McBrain really was and still is my drum hero for all those years.

I read the announcement on the official website of the band, which I visit once
in a while. However, I couldn't resist the urge to check out a fan forum. I
spent only a couple of minutes there, because I didn't care too much about
the speculations who's going to replace Nicko, even though I already bought
tickets for the next concert in July. But since the announcement came out
_before_ the last concert, I really hoped for a good final show, which I wanted
to check the next day.

The verdicts of the fans were unanimous: Nicko and the entire band finished the
tour with an absolute outstanding performance. I watched a couple of videos that
showed some impressions of that last show and Nicko leaving the stage for good.
I hope for a live album or some high-quality bootleg of that last show, so I
resisted to watch any further footage. I'm very happy that Nicko could step back
in dignity.

Fortunately, the new drummer was already announced a day later on the official
website, ending all the pointless speculations in the forums. I checked the
forum again, and the discussions were just the usual complaints. A couple of
forum members pointed out that Nicko's replacement, Simon Dawson, was probably
already prepared to step in during the last tour. This was the reason why his
band (British Lion) was touring together with Iron Maiden. (Iron Maiden founder
Steve Harris is also the man behind British Lion and probably prepared Dawson
for his new duties for a long time.) Besides that useful insight, there wasn't
anything informative to be found, and I didn't waste any more time on that forum.

Third, I also checked out some news on Alpine Skiing. The last weekend must have
been great for the Swiss athletes, especially for the men's team, which won all
three races in Beaver Creek. I watched a few videos about the races, but soon
noticed that I didn't care too much anymore.

So that weekend was quite a setback for my digital minimalism goals. However, I
learned a couple of things:

1. There's absolutely no need to check breaking news for current events, no
   matter how important they seem to be on a global scale. There is very little
   reliable information, which is just repeated by every major and minor news
   outlet. Wait until better minds have processed the information and did their
   research, then catch up on what has happened, if you're still interested in
   it—which you probably won't be.
2. You don't miss anything important if you stick to the official sources of the
   things you really care about. In my case, this was a band's official website.
   If they have something important to announce, you'll find it there. The
   community's speculations usually turn out to be totally wrong and worthless.
   Wait for official information.
3. With abstinence, harmful habits loose their appeal. Unfortunately, this isn't
   that easy for substance addictions like alcohol and heroin. But for mild
   behavioral addictions, such as visiting a particular set of websites multiple
   times a day, a couple of days of restraint can already work wonders.

With those lessons learned, I'm aware that I failed to abstain from the digital
distractions I set out to eliminate from my life. It's also true that I broke my
protocols for no good reason. However, I also learned that my protocols (e.g.
sticking to official websites for information) are all fine, so my trust in
those protocols increased. This should motivate me to try harder for the last
two thirds of December.
