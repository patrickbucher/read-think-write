The older I get, the less I care about what most other people and the
mainstream are telling me to think, buy, and do, and the more I focus on what
is observably beneficial to my life. Lacking focus and discipline has been an
issue throughout most of my adulthood, but thanks to the following authors and
their ideas, I made quite some progress in the last couple of years:

- **Jocko Willink**: In _Discipline Equals Freedom_, I learned that you can
  consistently get up before 5 o'clock in the morning to exercise, i.e. also on
  Saturdays and Sundays. Sleeping longer on the weekends, which is considered
  sacrosanct by most people, is totally unnecessary. If your life is good, you
  absolutely want to get up early in the morning. And going to sleep in the
  evening is not something you put off, because you're looking forward to the
  next day, for which you'd like to recharge. In the last nine months, I only
  missed roughly ten days when I had a cold (last fall) and a flu (this
  winter).
- **Joshua Fields Milburn**: In various books about minimalism, e.g.
  _Everything that Remains_, he showed me that life is better when you reduce
  your physical belongings to what you actually use. Credit also goes to other
  minimalists (Ryan Nicodemus, Leo Babauta, Joshua Becker, Courtney Carver,
  Marie Kondo, and many more). I got rid of a lot of stuff in recent months by
  selling it, donating it, or simply discarding it. (Read entries [15](#15) and
  [16](#16) why this is beneficial.)
- **Vox Day**: The _Socio-Sexual Hierarchy_, as described in his blog _Sigma
  Game_, is a very useful taxonomy for analyzing patterns of male behaviour.
  Even though it's mostly intended to understand and predict the behaviour of
  others, it's also useful for analyzing one's own behaviour. The author coined
  the term "Sigma", and the definitive book _Sigma Game_ about the Socio-Sexual
  Hierarchy shall be released later this year.
- **Rolf Dobelli**: Thanks to _Stop Reading the News_, I finally managed to
  ditch the media. Dobelli gives various reasons for doing so, and also made me
  aware of the _Circle of Competence_â€”which I still need to further enclose for
  my particular situation. I'm living news-free now for three years and can
  only recommend it.
- **Cal Newport**: In _Digital Minimalism_, I learned that it's not only the
  news that are detoriationg my concentration, but also digital distractions in
  general. I'm still in the process of limiting my computer usage, thereby
  turning it into a device that I'm using for work only. But I already got
  quite far: I haven't played any computer games for over a year now, and
  hardly watch videos. Having been a very light and only occasional user of
  social media, I've now banned it completely from my life. The constant cost
  of using it far outhweighs its occasional benefits.

Even though other thinkers (Nassim Taleb, Arthur Schopenhauer, Henry David
Thoreau, Ivan Illich, Erich Fromm, Eugen Drewermann, Neil Postman, Edsger
Dijkstra) and doers (Brian Kernighan, Paul Graham, Pieter Hintjens) might have
had a bigger impact on my worldview, the ones mentioned above gave me very
specific and actionable advice that considerably improved my life. I thank
those authors for their work, for which they had to go against the grain.
