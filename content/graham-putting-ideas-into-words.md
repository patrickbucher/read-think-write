I wanted to follow up on yesterday's idea that _proper thinking requires writing
down one's thoughts_. I found an essay written by Paul Graham called [Putting
Ideas into Words](https://paulgraham.com/words.html), which is exactly about
this issue.

Quickly summarized: Writing about something reveals your incomplete
understanding of it. It changes your ideas and uncovers misconceptions. The
ultimate test is reading what you've just written with the eyes of a stranger.
Hardly anybody thinks perfect thoughts that can be put into writing unchanged,
at least not about non-trivial subjects. However, some ideas, especially within
precisely defined domains, can be formed completely in one's head; but usually
those are rather paragraphs than entire texts. The need to explain an idea in
writing puts unconscious knowledge to conscience. Writing might not be the best
way to improve one's understanding of every subject, but it always helps.
Writing is the steeper hill than talking, because it lacks tone and voice, but
allows for and requires more iterations. Thoughts that aren't put under the test
of writing are incomplete. Writing is not a guarantee for right thoughts, but a
precondition.

In my [first post](#1), I mentioned that Socrates was known for not thinking
very highly of writing. This conflict is now resolved: one could also improve
one's understanding of an idea by talking about it, but:

> Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you
> can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I'll often spend
> 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in
> conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. 

We simply no longer argue on the city's marketplace but rather on the Internet,
which is often called a marketplace of ideas. One could argue that tone and
voice could be conveyed in some limited ways through the written word, even
without emojis. But the main point is that _phrasing_ gives our thoughts a shape
that allows them to be put to the test. Listening to an audio book or to a
podcast might be more convenient, but re-reading the same passage over and over
is certainly more convenient than re-playing it multiple times. The difference
is not so much about the written versus the spoken word, but between a raw
thought and a carefully crafted sentence.

As usual, Paul Graham hardly comes up with hard evidence in his essays. He
rather appeals to the reader's own experience and to common sense. This puts the
burden of proof on the readers, who then have to watch out for evidence in their
everyday experience. I certainly plan to do so in the future. Case in point: I
didn't know what to write about Graham's essay before I summarized it, even
though I read it multiple times prior to that. The thoughts only came to my
mind when I reviewed my own writing on the page. One could argue that my
thoughts are still incomplete, but now I can see evidence for the claims:
writing about the essay shaped my understanding of it.
