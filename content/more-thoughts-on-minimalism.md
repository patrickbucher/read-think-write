I wrote about why minimalism works and new year's resolutions don't [the other
day](#15). Since then, I was thinking more about the underlying reasons. There
are different aspects that contribute to the effects observed: The _process_,
the _insight_, and the _result_.

### The Process

Last Saturday, I was getting rid of cardboard, paper, and some electronic
equipment I could neither use nor sell. I usually rent a car roughly once every
three months, pick up all the things I'd like to get rid of at home, and drive
to the waste disposal facility, where I can dump everything for free.

Driving there with a full car and returning an empty car is quite a relief. But
why wait three months until renting a car for that drive becomes reasonable? If
I only wait for three weeks instead of three months, I'd have much less to
dispose of, and could actually walk there.

And so I did last Saturday. I had two bags of roughly 2-4 kg of cardboard each,
which isn't heavy, but becomes tiresome to carry nonetheless if you walk nonstop
for twenty minutes. I also had a pile of paper, five old plates, and some
electronic equipment in my backpack to get rid of, so I carried quite some load.

Having thrown everything into their proper containers, I walked out of the
facility with two free hands and a backpack only containing the two folded bags
I carried the cardboard in. I could literally feel being relieved from a burden.
Walking back felt great, and I even discovered a small hiking trail leading from
the industrial area to the mall. (I of course never noticed that trail when
driving by with the car for the last two years.)

I only knew it the other way around: Going to the store with empty bags and
returning with a load of heavy groceries, but looking forward to the meals I'm
going to prepare. Walking to some place to empty my bags not only didn't cost me
anything, but it also felt better than returning with filled shopping bags.
Going out with full bags and returning with empty ones physically felt better
than the other way around; disposing felt better than shopping. Maybe I should
give _impulse discarding_ a chance over _impulse shopping_, just for the
dopamine hit.

### The Insight

I'm selling and discarding a lot of books now, mostly technical books. I usually
buy a print/ebook bundle, and often so with an additional discount code. So I
usually pay roughly $40 for such a bundle, with some additional shipping fees
that are reasonable when you buy multiple books at once. Here's where it becomes
unreasonable: you add more books to your cart just to make the shipping fee look
reasonable, buying books you don't actually need.

Due to this pattern, I accumulated quite a collection of print books on
programming and other IT subjects. Besides my Kindle, which is now almost 10
years old, but still does its job, I own a PocketBook InkPad with a large
display that allows me to read programming books quite comfortably. I just
discovered that I can upload my own fonts, and with a combination of the font
Bitter (which I also use on this page), Lato, and Fantasque Sans Mono, reading
technical books on that device finally became pleasure.

It's pleasurable enough that I decided to get rid of most of my technical books
that I bought in a print/ebook bundle, only retaining the ebooks I can download
from the publisher's website at a whim. I'm selling the respective print
counterparts on Ricardo, which is a Swiss platform similar to eBay. I offer
those books in auctions starting at the lowest possible price of CHF 1.- to make
sure I'll get rid of them. If nobody wants to buy them, I'll gift them to
friends and students—or I'll just throw them away, for their market value is
empirically zero.

Doing so, my technical book collection is about to shrink to a reasonable size.
But what's more interesting: I don't feel the urge to buy any more technical
books! Those purchases no longer appeal to me, because I noticed how tedious it
is to deal with books afterwards: You either make proper use of them by
reading them carefully, nay, by _working_ through them, which you can do at a
rate of roughly one book per month or less. Or you sell them, which takes more
effort then buying them in the first place—not accounting for the money to be
earned to pay for them in the first place. You can also just throw them away,
which is rather painful, especially if the books are any good. (Giving them away
as gifts doesn't feel as good as many people describe it, probably because I'm
already used to giving books away, albeit ones that I actually read and won't
re-read.)

It's one thing to _understand_ that you don't need to buy any more stuff, but
it's way more compelling to actually _feel_ the pain of discarding things you
spent good money on. But where there is pain, there is also healing and relief.
I'm cured of buying books I don't absolutely want to read. And while discarding
books, I also decided to retain some very good ones, which reveals my real
subjects of interest.

### The Result

The result of decluttering is the most obvious and compelling reason for
minimalism: You end up with only the things you actually like. I no longer have
to think about which shirt I put on in the morning, I just take the topmost off
of my stack in the dresser.

The bookshelf is finally big enough to allow for _random access_ to every book:
I no longer have to put aside a pile of books from the first row in order to
access the books in the second row; I can just pick a book single-handedly. And
I'm also aware of what books, clothes, etc. I own , so that I can make
productive use of everything I have.

However, those results are only temporary. Going through a round of discarding
books or clothes leaves me with the impression that I can't possibly get rid of
any more things. A week or so later, I not only forgot about what I've thrown
out already, but I find new things I actually don't want to keep.

Once you stepped over your initial loss aversion, you feel less and less remorse
when getting rid of things on which you lost quite some money, be it by selling
them for pennies on the dollar, or by simply throwing them away.

I always believed that minimalism works and improves your life. However, in
order to pull through, I need to understand the _why_ of minimalism. I'll
further think about the reasons behind its effectiveness, preferably while
carrying bags of discardable items to the dump—or rather while walking away
from there relieved of my burden.
