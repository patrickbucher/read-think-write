In his essay [Beyond Smart](https://paulgraham.com/smart.html), Paul Graham
argues that intelligence is a precondition but not sufficient for having new
ideas. Summarized:

> Einstein wasn't just smart, but had important new ideas. Intelligence isn't
> enough for high achievements. Discovering new ideas is more desirable than
> being smart. The idea that intelligence is the most important quality is an
> illusion fed to us since childhood. Having new ideas is historically less
> important than winning in conversation thanks to superior intelligence. What
> additional qualities are required for having new ideas? Unlike intelligence,
> many of those qualities can be cultivated. Once you accept that intelligence
> isn't the most important quality, new possibilities arise. There's no
> consensus about what matters if it's not just intelligence. An obsessive
> interest in a topic is an important quality. Being independent-minded, which
> is related to intelligence, is another one. Working on your own projects and
> overcoming obstacles is a good technique. Other qualities are most prevalent
> in youth: enough sleep, good health, a lot of free time, little stress and few
> responsibilities. Writing ability allows you to discover new ideas by writing
> about them. The gap between intelligence and having new ideas is not a
> wasteland of unrealized potential, but a resource for new discoveries.

Again, the ability to write stands out as one of the qualities than can be
cultivated. The other ingredients—health, sleep, the lack of responsibilities
and stress—are life-style choices that require prioritizing. (Earning less to
have more time is a hard tradeoff to make.)

The essay is the perfect text form to discover new ideas. I don't know if the
word has a latin source—and since _this_ is an essay, I don't bother looking it
up. But _essayer_ is a French verb that means "trying (out)", so an essay is a
text in which the author tries out new ideas.

While summarizing the essay, particularly the paragraph about having an
obsessive interest in a particular topic, I had a realization that is linked to
the optimistic tone of the essay: What if I could turn my most important
annoyances into a career? I'm clearly annoyed by the way so-called "knowledge
workers" approach their work on a daily basis. This bothers me, because I'm
constantly pulled into their ways of doing things, which prevents me from
cultivating habits for undistracted, deep work that I value so much.

I suffer from this through my entire working life of more than 20 years. Why
wasn't I able to turn this annoyance into something meaningful? Changing the
behaviour of other people is next to impossible, and working alone or only
together with a few select like-minded people… well, I actually didn't try that
out yet. I actually had to stop in the middle of the sentence here to reconsider
the issue.

> [Y]ou don't think of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There
> is a kind of thinkng that one does by writing[.]

If I would like to have good ideas once in a while, maybe I just should keep
clear of people that don't share my views on how to organize work on a daily
basis. Other annoyances are business people that incessantly follow each trend
of the year, e.g. adding AI to every product (and conversation) in 2024, or
using a blockchain for anything in 2021. They might be good customers to a snake
oil salesman, which is not the career path I've chosen.

I founded my own company so that I could be in control of my time and pick the
people with whom I work together. The mode of working could become a
selling-point: I'm not jumping on the AI bandwagon, nor will I spend my days in
video conferences that achieve nothing; but I'm offering focused deep work hours
for actual problem solving.
