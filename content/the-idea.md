Paul Graham's short and sober essay [Writes and
Write-Nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html) strongly resonated with me:
Maybe writing is the next big thing, not _despite_ the fact that it can easily
be replicated using AI tools nowadays, but _because_ of it: When everybody is
delegating writing to AI tools, nobody will be capable of doing it on its own in
the foreseeable future. And because clear thinking requires clear writing, as
Paul Graham claims, only those who can write will be able to think in the
future.

> [W]riting is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be
> done by writing.

This claim seems shaky, especially when one considers Sokrates, who didn't hold
writing in high esteem. Paul Graham usually does not elaborate on his premises
in his rather short essays. But let's accept this premise for the moment.

If writing and thinking will become rare skills, those who are able to write and
think will have huge benefits in the future. Those benefits will become clear
within a generation, say, in 15-25 years, when those using AI tools for every
task will establish themselves in the workforce.

So the next big thing isn't AI (or Blockchain, or Big Data, or DevOps, or Cloud
Computing), it's _thinking_. Investing time in reading (to get new material for
thinking), thinking, and writing is the ultimate long-term bet.
