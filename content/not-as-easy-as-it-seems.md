title: "Not as Easy as It Seems"

I teach a Software Engineering course to four different classes (17+ year old students). For an upcoming assignment (Pair Programming), I'd like the students to build groups of two (and one group of three for classes with an odd number of students) and report those groups to me. For this purpose, I created a Teams assignment with the instruction to _hand in a text file with the full name of the partner(s)_. The task is easy: Once the partner is found, write the partner's name into a text file and upload it, then press the "Submit" button.

Now I understand that technically it would be enough if only one of the two partners handed in the text file. However, since one class isn't here this week, I cannot supervise the students and their partner finding process, and therefore can't tell if a consensus really was found, or if somebody just reported his or her preferred partner. So having every student handing in the text file not only keeps my records clean (to see who already has reported a partner and who hasn't), but also helps me to double check whether or not a consensus really was established. Furthermore, I already have a documented record of the partner finding process. Sounds reasonable, right?

So what's all this about?

I suspect to get a lot of questions along the lines of: "Do I also need to submit the text file? Or is it enough if my partner does it?" To which I'll reply: "Please just hand it in, too!" And for the anticipated add-on question: "But why do I need to do this? You already know the groups after one member submitted the partner!" I'll answer: "Because then I know at a glance who hasn't reported a partner yet, and I can approach them right away without having to build up my groups sheet in advance. Performing the assigned task takes less time and effort than leading this conversation already did. So please do it now!"

I wonder how many remarks along the lines of "But that's ridiculous!" I'll get. I hope for the best, but am prepared for the worst. Stay tunedâ€¦
