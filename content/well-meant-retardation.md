> The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Nowadays, one is expected to _give feedback_ on mostly everything: products bought, courses attended, students taught, etc. Feedback used to be requested in a scheme consisting of _positive_ and _negative_ remarks, and maybe some _suggestions for improvements_.

Nowadays, the _negative_ category is often dropped entirely, and one is expected to only report back _positive_ remarks and _suggestions for improvements_. The goal of the whole process is to improve something, of course, so why not just asking directly for what to improve? Why bother with all that negativity, after all?

A cure requires 1) the detection of symptoms, 2) a diagnosis, and 3) the prescription of the therapy. While the original process at least required step 1) and 3), the new process jumps ahead to step 3) straight away: No symptoms are detected, no diagnosis is made, but a therapy is prescribed. Not asking for the negative remarks in feedback is similar to a doctor not caring about the symptoms.

Another disease is the proliferation of all those _initiatives_ in the corporate world, which never focus on problem solving, but rather on introducing special kinds of _tools_ in the broadest sense: "Agile", Big Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, or the over-priced products of a certain Australian company.

Programmers and engineers always start with a _problem_. Then they explore the space of possible _solutions_. To overcome the gap between the problem and the solution, certain _tools_ are required. So the problem comes first, the tool comes last.

But in the corporate world, the use of word "problem" is frowned upon. It's the same mechanism at work here: everything resembling negativity is outright hidden, only the positive and uplifting is allowed to surface.

Consider a directed graph where an edge (i.e. a solution) leads from a bad (negative) to a good (positive) state. We know that we're at the bad place, we know that we're supposed to move towards the good place, and we know the path to cross for that purpose. But for some reason it is not allowed to state 1) where the bad state is located, and 2) why it is bad to be there. Try drawing a graph with an edge leading to a node named _good_, but it must not be stated where the node is located from which that edge goes out.

Finding a solution requires a clear problem statement. Unfortunately, many people mistake the tool for the solution, which is then applied in vain. Where people are not allowed to clearly state problems, nothing is ever improved, because you can't move into the right direction when you don't know where you start.

I once worked for a company where the CEO reacted allergic to the use of the word "problem". There were only "issues", "challenges", and "solutions", of course. The company spent millions on developing and re-developing a portal hardly anybody ever bothered to use, because the actual problem the portal tried to solve was going away while the engineers were busy making the platform better scalable for the millions of users that never came.

Always be wary if you cannot state what's going wrong or if you cannot call a problem a problem. Chances are you are part of a cult rather than an organziation that tries to improve things _by solving problems_.
