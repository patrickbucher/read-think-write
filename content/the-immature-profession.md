A _Hackathon_ is an event where groups of programmers gather for 24 hours in order to churn out some software prototype. They have to work through the night, of course, and therefore work in a condition of sleep deprivation, which they try to remedy by drinking copious amounts of so-called "energy drinks" and eating junk food.

In other words: A Hackathon is a celebrated practice session to re-inforce the industries worst habits. It not only produces subpar code for prototypes probably nobody is going to use, it also ruins the sleep-wake rhythm of the participants for days thereafter.

It also tries to turn brain work into a spectacle, and knowledge workers into athletes (just without the health benefits of actual exercise). The organisers usually also hand out literal participation trophies and some gadgets from the event's sponsors, e.g. Amazon Alexa devices, which no person with basic IT knowledge should ever consider using.

The participants aren't paid for their contribution, which was created on behalf of the organizer and its sponsors. They are obviously happy with a six-pack of Red Bull and some candy bars. Some Hackathons offer a decent buffet, while still being compliant to the desperate programmer's mantra "I'll code for food".

The event takes place in an open-plan setting, of course, which is supposed to facilitate… _communication_! Of course, "communication" means strictly oral, face-to-face exchanges of words. A carefully composed email or a thought written down for further consideration do not belong to the realm of communication as perceived in such circles, in which orality is still king.

There's no room to think, but only to act. Laying out a plan is way too _upfronty_ in an age that only knows one mode of work: the "agile" way, which is to constantly react to surprises that could have been worked out by some consideration in the first place. The usual acts of cult ("daily standup meeting") have to be dropped for once, of course, because everything is urgent and everybody is busy, which is further testament to those fair weather "methodologies" elaborated by some pot-bellied boomers in a ski resort in the late nineties.

Now imagine a _Lawathon_ where lawyers in suits gather for 24 hours in order to churn out some new legislation. How about a _Engineerathon_, where civil engineers work through the night just to have the design for a new bridge ready in the next morning. Or how about a _Surgathon_? Surgeons are used to long medical procedures, after all. Just withhold the patient's dossier in advance, so that they can figure out the issue once the patient is cut open. _Agile, yeah!_

"But wait, you're comparing apples with tomatoes! You're comparing programming with… err, you're comparing professionals to… err…" Yes: I'm comparing professionals and professional work to _hacks_.
