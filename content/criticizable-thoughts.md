A thought only becomes criticizable for others when it is written down. Having
an idea is cheap, writing it down less so: Deniability—_"I was just thinking 
aloud!"_—is gone, and a thought can be scrutinized.

Once you've written something down and handed it over to others, you are
somewhat invested in it. Admitting that the idea was stupid comes at a cost.
One has to give the idea up and admit failure. This is nothing bad per se, but
not everybody is used to admitting failure. If you don't like to admit that an
idea of yours was half-baked or outright bad, better don't pass it to others in
written form.

The more you are invested in an idea, the harder it is to admit that it was a
bad one. People who just talk about an idea, but never put it down in writing,
don't have to admit that it was bad, but rather can always claim that it was
just misunderstood. As long as the idea is only uttered verbally, one can say
that it wasn't stated in full, and some crucial bits of it have been withheld.

Once written down, a certain completeness of an idea is expected. There are no
longer excuses that something wasn't put down completely, for there are higher
expectations on the written word than on a casual conversation. One is expected
to go over what he has written down before giving it to others, thereby noticing
gaps to be filled in. A conversation can always remain incomplete, and it is
totally acceptable to continue talking about an idea later on. Contrary to this,
sending out a sloppy draft to others for serious consideration is rather rude.

Ideas can be discussed and further refined in brain-storming sessions and the
like. However, as soon as further action has to be taken to follow up on an
idea, it first needs to be written down to establish a common ground. This is
especially important if _other_ people than the originator of an idea have to
act on it. Otherwise, those people can be blamed unjustly for _"not getting the
idea"_ once failure becomes obvious.

Somebody who's not willing to carefully write an idea down doesn't want to be
criticized or held accountable for it. He probably is not convinced of his own
idea. An idea should not be taken seriously as long as its originator refuses
to write it down. The originator should also not be taken too seriously in that
respect, for he prefers fantasizing to thinking, and rather remains dwelling in
his cloud-castle than confronting criticism of the unwashed on the market-place
of ideas. Lofty ideas and cloud-castles are both made out of thin air after all;
neither of them can be grasped.
