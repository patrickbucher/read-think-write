A thought only becomes criticizable for others when it is written down. Having
ideas is cheap, writing them down less so: Deniability—"I was just thinknig
aloud!"—is gone, and the thoughts can be criticized. If you write something down
and hand it over to others, you are somewhat invested in this idea. Admitting
that an idea was stupid comes with a cost. One has to give the idea up and admit
failure. This is nothing bad per se, but not everybody is used to it. The more
you are invested into an idea, the harder it is to admit that it was a bad idea.
People who jus talk about their ideas but never put them down in writing don't
have to admit that their ideas are bad, but rather could always claim that their
idea was just misunderstood. As long as the idea was only uttered verbally, one
can say that it wasn't already stated in full. Once written down, a certain
completeness of the idea is expected.
