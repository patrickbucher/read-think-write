In [book II, chapter
II](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky/the-brothers-karamazov/constance-garnett/text/chapter-1-2-2)
of _The Brothers Karamazov_, Fyodor Dostoyevsky tells us about a gathering at
the hermitage of _Father Zossima_. Among the visitors is _Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov_—one of the novel's main characters: a notorious drunkard, debaucher,
profiteer, and liar.

During the conversation, Fyodor Pavlovitch recounts various anecdotes, in which
he frames himself as a fool, but also tries to irritate _Pyotr Alexandrovitch
Miusov_—a liberal, who's also among the guests—by casting a shadow on him.

Reacting to Fyodor Pavlovitch's affected shame, Father Zossima urges him:

> “You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough:
> don’t give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don’t give way to
> sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. […] And, above all—don’t
> lie. […] Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and
> listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the
> truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for
> others. […] The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than
> anyone. You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn’t it? A
> man may know that nobody has insulted him, but that he has invented the
> insult for himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has
> caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill—he knows that himself,
> yet he will be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment
> till he feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness.
> But get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing.”

Fyodor Pavlovitch acts if he were deeply moved by this words, kisses the
Father's hand as if in rapture, but then immediately starts blaming Miusov for
having shaken with his fate by recounting an anecdote Miusov supposedly told
years ago at a dinner party.

When Father Zossima leaves the room, Fyodor Pavlovitch tells him that he only
acted as if he were a fool in order to test the Father.

### Gamma Detected, Gamma Confirmed

This all reads like a textbook description of a [Gamma
Male](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhTFkUpB8zc&pp=ygURdm94aXZlcnNpdHkgZ2FtbWE%3D).
Fyodor Pavlovitch:

- compulsively needs to make a fool of himself,
- suffers from an annoying level verbal incontinence by telling inappropriate
  anecdotes (literal walls of text in the printed novel),
- tries to pull himself up by pushing others down,
- obviously lies to everybody—but especially to himself—without fooling anybody,
- acts if he just pretended when he is finally called out for his dishonesty.

Only a future saint like the Father Zossima, who immediately sees through
Fyodor Pavlovitch's posturing, can muster the level of restraint needed in
order to not be irritated by this shameful behaviour.

Furthermore, Fyodor Pavlovitch shows absolutely zero empathy for his two sons,
who are also part of the gathering, especially towards his youngest son
Alyosha, who reveres the Father Zossima as his disciple. (Alyosha is visibly
ashamed during the whole gathering.)

The Gamma definitively exists, and he even existed back in czarist Russia of
the 19th century. Fortunately, the cure also exists, and existed long ago, as
Dostoyevsky put it very concisely into Father Zossima's mouth.
