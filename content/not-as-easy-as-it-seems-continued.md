Let's review the [assignment from last week](/#20), in which I asked students
to find a partner for a pair programming exercise and to report that person's
full name in a text file.

Let's start with the positive observation: There was little arguing during
class. When I was asked if both members of a pair needed to hand in the
textfile, I affirmed and walked away.

Unfortunately, I only got around to check the status of the assignment after
the lesson. But the students got a calendar entry with a reminder to hand in
the exercise. Here's the result of 66 students:

- 22 students handed in what I asked them for: A text file containing the full
  name(s) of their partner(s). This made it really easy for me to write down
  and double-check the pairings.
- 25 students handed in something useful, but not exactly what I asked for.
  Some handed in a Word document, which takes longer to open than a text file.
  Others wrote both names inside, which is ok. Some didn't write the full name,
  but only the first name, which required me to look up the exact name instead
  of just copying-pasting it. Those were minor annoyances, but I was able to
  gather the pairings with a couple of seconds of additional work in each case.
- 16 students didn't hand in anything. In most cases, this didn't allow me to
  double-check the pairing. Since I saw most pairs only working together
  (without remembering all), I assume that the partially reported pairings are
  ok for both partners. I was able to excuse most of them, but also had to
  extend the deadline for others, which requires another iteration on my sideâ€”a
  major annoyance. In one case, there were two students left, which I then
  paired together on my own.
- One student submitted it right after my reminder, one was excused due to a
  longer absence, and one student submitted something entirely different.

Even though I had to answer less questions than anticipated (and less annoying
ones, too), I'm not able to assign the next tasks, because some pairings still
haven't been reported days later for no good reason.

Given a very simple and clearly stated task, one third did exactly what I asked
for, one third did something I was able to work with, and one third failed at
this very simple task, thereby wasting my time.

Documenting this assignment was a good experience for me, because it
accompanies my sentiment with data. There's way less smart-boyism (arguing
about the task), but more negligence and lazyness than I anticipated.
