December is a good occasion for an information diet. Unlike with a new year
resolution for digital minimalism in January, I'd like to start the new year
cleansed from mental clutter. So I started my month of digital minimalism today.

I'm following the plan layed out in Cal Newport's book _Digital Minimalism_;
more precisely in the third chapter called _The Digital Declutter_. No matter if
you call it an _Information Diet_, a _Dopamine Detox_, or a _Digital Declutter_,
the idea is to wean yourself off of optional online activities for a thirty day
period, after which you deliberately reconsider taking up some of those
activities—or to stay abstinent from them for good.

The key to the process is that on the one hand you only have to restrict
yourself for a very limited period of time, which makes it a lot easier. _"I
will be allowed to binge-watch Netflix again after that thirty day period, just
not now."_ sounds a lot more feasible than _"I will never be allowed to
binge-watch Netflix for the rest of my life."_

On the other hand, chances are that you no longer feel the urge to binge-watch
Netflix after that thirty day period, because you got rid of that particular
addiction. Yes: those products have been carefully engineered by multi-billion
dollar companies so that you spend as much time on them as possible, which is
the subject of the first chapter of _Digital Minimalism_ called _A Lopsided Arms
Race_.

Cal Newport emphasizes that you absolutely need to fill the void created by
abstaining from optional online activities, which use up a lot of our leisure
time. You need to pick up activities such as woodworking, exercising—and also
something you can do without special equipment or a lot of preparation. In my
case, it's reading and writing to my [daily dump](#3). In December, I have a lot
do do already, so I won't be bored anyway. I just need to fill those idle
minutes in between activities.

So what am I putting on hold for the rest of the year?

1. _Videos_: I already kicked the YouTube watching habit earlier this year. Now
   I'd like to be more consequent. I deliberately deactivated my YouTube
   history, so that no recommendations are being shown when I land on the
   website. I'll continue to record videos for the classes I'm teaching, which I
   review offline, but without a history, I won't be pulled back into watching
   random videos. One exception is watching movies in a social setting. Showing
   video examples in classes is also OK, but I won't research new examples for
   the time being. (Most students' attention span is below twenty seconds anyway,
   so videos are not helpful to grab their attention any longer.)
2. _Social Media_: I temporarely deactivated my LinkedIn account earlier this
   year, and I don't feel the urge to reactivate it. I'll spend some time on the
   _German Debian Forum_, for which I'll write a couple of articles in December.
   I'll also participate in the discussions surrounding my articles, which is
   kind of a duty for me as their author. But I won't join any (political)
   discussions in the _Smalltalk_ forum. Technical forums and StackOverflow are
   OK, as long as they support my professional goals.
3. _News_: I kicked the news checking loop habit almost two years ago. However,
   I still follow some blogs, which often link to news stories. I refrain from
   clicking on those original sources, except if longer essays from non-news
   publications are linked to. However, I used to check those blogs multiple
   times a day.  Checking those blogs only once a day didn't work, so let's go
   further down to zero checks per day, at least until the end of 2024.
4. _Books_: I won't buy any books this month, but rather read those I already
   have, which are a lot. My worst addiction is buying books. Putting them on a
   whish list, which I re-consider after a couple of weeks, saves a lot of money
   and shelf space, because most books don't appeal to me a couple of weeks
   later. And I rather have those books on a whish list than on my bookshelf—and
   the money rather in my bank account than in Amazon's. I also must not check
   the websites of technical book publishers, which I do a lot, even though they
   just publish a new book once or twice a week.
5. _Games_: I stopped playing video games earlier this year, but I just make it
   explicit that I won't take up that nasty habit again. Gaming makes it harder
   to focus afterwards, makes me fidgety, and leads to poor sleep. And I
   absolutely need some good sleep every night.
6. _Sports_: No Formula 1 races, no Ski Alpine races—except in a social setting.
   I wanted to wean myself off of Formula 1 for ages, which just wastes my
   Sunday afternoons. The season will be over soon anyway, but I must not check
   any news about the sport in the meantime. For Ski Alpine races, I actually
   consider to gather some friends in my office space to have a good time
   together with a couple of beers. It's a lot more enjoyable to watch races
   together, anyway.

I also set some rules for listening to music (not while working) and for online
shopping, but those aren't the biggest problems.

I'll be reading and writing a lot more during that time. And hopefully, I'll be
more efficient and effective when doing my work, of which I have quite a lot to
do in December.

Rowing for 10 kilometers every morning at five o'clock is a very beneficial
habit. Since September 9th, I didn't miss a single day. If I stay healthy, I'd
like to stick to it through the entire winter, except when spending the night
somehwere else, which is quite possible on Christmas.

I'll also continue my [Daily Frontend
Grind](https://github.com/patrickbucher/daily-frontend-grind-q4-2024), which is
the activity following the rowing session (and the shower right afterwards).
Learning TypeScript isn't the most intellectually stimulating activity, but I
just want to have that language available in my toolbox for the future.

I'm looking forward to start my new year with a refreshed and uncluttered mind,
which I'll plan to fill with [mathmematics](#8) and maybe the Elixir/Phoenix
tech stack—and with a lot of good literature.
